Task 1:
Given two lists of location IDs, compute the total distance between the lists by sorting both lists, pairing up the smallest numbers from each, and calculating the sum of the absolute differences between each pair.

Task 2:
Given the same two lists, compute a similarity score by multiplying each number from the left list by how many times it appears in the right list and summing these values.
