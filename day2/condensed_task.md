Task 1:
Given multiple reports (each containing a list of numbers), determine how many reports are "safe." A report is safe if:

The numbers are either all increasing or all decreasing.
The difference between any two adjacent numbers is between 1 and 3 (inclusive).

Task 2:
Update the analysis to handle the "Problem Dampener," which allows the removal of one level in an unsafe report. A report is now safe if:

It can be made safe by removing one level, or if it's already safe.
Apply the same rules as Task 1, considering the possibility of removing one number.
Count how many reports are now safe after applying the Problem Dampener.
