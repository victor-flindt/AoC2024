Task 1:
Given a word search grid, find all occurrences of the word "XMAS" in any direction: horizontally, vertically, diagonally, forwards, backwards, and overlapping. Count the total number of times the word "XMAS" appears.

Task 2:
In this variation, find occurrences of two "MAS" words arranged in the shape of an "X" (i.e., with one "MAS" forming the top left to bottom right diagonal and another forming the top right to bottom left diagonal). Count how many times this "X-MAS" shape appears in the grid.
